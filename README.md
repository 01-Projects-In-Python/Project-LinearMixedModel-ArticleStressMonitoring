Purpose:__<br>
Explore the physiological signals dataset and replicating the work Iqbal et al (2022) but using only one data analysis matrix, which is the linear mixed model

Objectives:__<br>
    
1. Conduct an EDA analysis on the given dataset and identify missing values outliers.<br>
2. Identify what linear mixed model that the study used.<br>
3. Conduct the prediction tasks and interpret the predicted models. <br>
6. Compare the results with the studyâ€™s results.<br>
7. Conclusions.<br>
